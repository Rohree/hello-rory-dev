        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Embrace Relentless Curiosity</strong> As a frontend developer, curiosity is my fuel. I refuse to accept limits. Every piece of code, every design element, every interaction is an opportunity to dig deeper. I am on a journey to master the ever-evolving world of web technologies. My mission is to learn something new every day, no matter how small, and apply that knowledge to craft experiences that inspire.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Code with Purpose</strong> My code isn‚Äôt just a series of characters; it‚Äôs a bridge between imagination and reality. With every line, I aim to build experiences that matter, products that people love, and interfaces that connect users to stories and solutions. I believe in writing clean, efficient, and scalable code that not only works but makes a difference in the lives of its users.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Break Barriers, One Bug at a Time</strong> Bugs are not obstacles; they are opportunities. I don‚Äôt shy away from challenges. Instead, I confront them head-on, solving problems with resilience and creativity. Whether it's a small UI glitch or a deep-rooted issue in the codebase, I treat every bug as a stepping stone towards mastering my craft.
